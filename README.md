# Jira epic issue issue bulk opener

On an epic page in Jira, makes a link appear above the list of issues in the epic. The link will open each issue in a new tab.



Limitations:
- Only for epics (may add support for story subtasks etc in the future)
- Only when on an epic page, i.e. not when viewing it as a sidepanel etc (again, may add that in the future).
